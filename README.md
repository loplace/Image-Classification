# Image Classification

Project for the course of Algorithm for the web at University of Rome Tor Vergata, focusing on developing a deep neural network
to classify Images. 
In this github page you can find the Python code as well as some links to datasets. 
Different files offer a different-tuned NN.
Code is entirely written in Python and makes use of Keras API. 

## Prerequisites
In order to run this project you need the following softwares to be installed on your computer:
* Python 3.6
* Tensorflow

## Configuration
* Change the path to datasets inside .py files. 

## Datasets
Cats and Dogs Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
Fruits: https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset (note: repository in evolution, 77 tags when this readme has been written, probably the number is going to increase in near future)
